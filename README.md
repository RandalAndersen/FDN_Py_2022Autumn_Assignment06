# FDN_Py_2022Autumn_Assignment06
The Python program for CDInventory.py, Documentation and the CDInventory.txt file
The project for Assignment06 is to utilize an existing program which generates a menu for loading, viewing, saving, and deleting CD titles and the Artist's name from a list. This program has been modified to use functions and introduces classes. Finally, we incorporate DocString to help document the components and intention of code blocks.
